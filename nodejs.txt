//Theory
NodeJS : Opensource cp runtime evironment of dev and network apps of NodeJS
Js engine : Js code to machine code 
V8 engine can run stande=alone or can be embed into any c++ application
Node JS build on V8 Engine
NodeJS= Runtime env+Js library on
NodeJS is free from  deadlocking(Sitauation where a set of process are blocked because each process is holding a res and waiting for res aquired by other process)
Task  performed based on events. Its asynchronous. Never waits for an api to return data to the
Notification mechanism of events of nodejs helps to receive events from previous api calls.
NodeJs is a single threaded app but support concurency by events and callbacks are
every api of node is async 
uses observer pattern . keeps and event loop , whenever a task a completed it fires corresponding evets which can uses event listener to execute
IO operations are non blocking. after you pass I/p server wont block resources until getting op, so we can move to another ip


Application Server:
An app inside a server that contains the logic about the applicationhow to responds to various methods of the applicationbased on http request and URI request
HTTP method+ URI = router.method
matching a rout based on request = routing

Database:

Interface to save data in a persistent way.
Avoid server crashes by reducing load on main memory of CPU and memory
API: Application programming Interface
Set of programming instructons for web based application
Fetch data from outside sources in response to a client request and
Store data on other apps
Clients : Web browse/ api/ CLIENT
HTTP Request: text string -> URI(location of server)+ Verb


GET : Asks for the resource to be returned unchanges, data is returnedget embedded with headers and
POST: USed to submit an entity often causing a change in state of server 
PUT: Used to update(editing) 
DELETE: Used to remove a resource from the server

HTTP Response: Status code+ Message body
Message body is displayed on browser
Datatypes: Number String Boolean Undefined null regexp
Buffer(used to store binary data)

Functions: Similar to class in Js. 
Node has facility to process info like id, achitrcture, version , platform, version using process obj
Used for exception handling
//Scope of obj and properties are limited 

NodeJS Modules
______________

As app gets bigger , we will split into multiple files 
called modules. A module contains a class/lib of fns. 
One script is one module. Each file is treated as a seperate module
Module helps to encapsulation of code into manageable chunks
Anything defined inside module is private to that module only

Modules are classified int core , third party and node

Core : pre installed with nodeJs
Eg: of 3rd party modules Express and Mongo
Core modules

Combined in bin and load automatically when node starts
os: gives info about OS
Always use Async method
